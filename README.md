# Self-help-mental-health-app-TEJ

Mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety has become common in recent years
due to improved awareness about it. Yet, due to lack of resources, there are still many
people who do not have access to aid. Many people suffering from day-to-day pressures
do need regular and urgent assistance. Our technology aims to provide all these peo-
ple with a smartphone platform as a solution. The app will support people who suffer
from depression, stress or anxiety or simply want to improve their moods through an
intelligent chatbot, offering things such as guided meditation and other remedies like
music, motivational quotes, videos, etc. The app will also encourage users to book a
mental health specialist appointment in case severe mental health issues are identified.
The doctors dashboard would allow them to monitor the progress / history of their pa-
tients. Furthermore, our app will also include a notes module where doctors can post
their patients notes or prescriptions.We believe this innovative and interactive approach
can help people fight mental illness by reaching a broader audience.
